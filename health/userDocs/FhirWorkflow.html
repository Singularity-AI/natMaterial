<h2>Introduzione</h2>
 <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html" target="fhirweb"><ks>Workflow</ks> (FHIR 12.5 Workflow Description)</a> 
 is an essential part of healthcare - orders, care protocols, referrals are the drivers of most activity within in-patient settings 
 and a great deal of activity in community care as well. 
 <br/><br/>
 FHIR is concerned with workflow when there's a need to <b>share information about workflow state or relationships</b>, 
 when there's a need to <b>coordinate or drive</b> the execution of workflow across systems and when there's a need to <b>define allowed actions, 
 dependencies and conditions</b> on behavior.
 <br/><br/>
 FHIR <b>does not need to be used</b> for the execution of workflow. 
 Orders, care plans, lab results, hospital admissions, claim payments and other records can all be shared using FHIR resources 
 without the process to solicit fulfillment of those orders or requesting payment of those claims being driven by a FHIR transaction. 
 <i>Interoperable support for workflow execution</i> is a more advanced FHIR activity because it requires a <b>higher degree of standardization</b>. 
 Rather than merely standardizing the data to exchange, interoperable workflow execution requires standardization of the processes, 
 roles and activities across the different systems. 
 <br/><br/>
FHIR supports a variety of interoperability paradigms and most of them (<ks>REST, Messaging and Services</ks>) provide support for driving workflow execution. 

  <br/><br/>
 However, even without using FHIR for workflow execution, there's still a need to standardize the data elements related to workflow.
   <br/><br/>

   
 <table style="width:100%" border="1">
 <tr><td style="width:50%"><ks>Workflow definition</ks>
 The definition of protocols, order sets, guidelines and other structures that define what sorts of activities should occur, 
 what order they should occur on, what dependencies they have, in what circumstances they should start or end, etc. is handled by a pair of resources:

<ul>
<li> <a href="#activitydef" target="fhirweb">ActivityDefinition</a>  defines an activity to be performed as a single step</li>
<li> <a href="#plandef" target="fhirweb">PlanDefinition</a>     defines the interrelationships of steps and the rules around their execution</li>
</ul>
 
FHIR defines three categories of resources that are involved in activities - requests, events and definitions.
Each of these categories has a <k>"pattern"</k> associated with it.
<br/><br/>
 <ks>Workflow</ks> resources describe 
	<ul>
	<li>things that can be done (<k>definitions</k>)</li>
	<li>things that are desired to be done (<k>requests</k>)</li>
	<li>things that have been done (<k>events</k>)</li>
	</ul>

<tr><td><h3><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html" target="fhirweb">    12.5.1.1 Workflow resources</h3></a>
Not all resources in FHIR are related to workflow - many are used to describe entities and roles (patients, medications, etc.) or 
infrastructure (structure definitions, value sets, etc.). 
<br/><br/>
However, a large proportion of the FHIR resources are devoted to the description of activities in one fashion or another and almost 
all of these fall into the realm of workflow - they describe things that can be done (definitions), 
are desired to be done (requests) or that have been done (events). <br/><br/>
The table summarizes the list of workflow-relevant resources.

<tr  id="activitydef"><td>
<h3><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/activitydefinition.html" target="fhirweb">12.17 Resource ActivityDefinition</a></h3>
An <ks>ActivityDefinition</ks> is a shareable, consumable description of some activity to be performed. It may be used to specify actions to be taken 
as part of a workflow, order set, or protocol, or it may be used independently as part of a catalog of activities such as orderables. 

<br/><br/>
An activity definition is simply a <b>conceptual description</b> of some specific action that should be taken. 
An instance of an <tt>ActivityDefinition</tt> does not indicate that any action has been performed (as an event resource does), 
nor does it indicate the actual intent to carry out any particular action (as a request resource does).<br/> 
Instead, an activity definition provides a <i>reusable template</i> that can be used to construct specific request resources such as 
<tt>ServiceRequest</tt> and <tt>MedicationRequest</tt>.
<br/><br/>
This is conceptually similar to the <a href="#Taskl" target="fhirweb">Task</a>  resource as well, 
with the distinction being that <tt>ActivityDefinition</tt> represents the <b>description of a task in the abstract</b>, 
while the <a href="#Taskl" target="fhirweb">Task</a> resource is used to track a specific instance of a task as it moves through the steps of a workflow.
<br/><br/>
This resource is referenced by <tt>CarePlan, CatalogEntry, Communication, DeviceRequest, EvidenceVariable, FamilyMemberHistory, MessageDefinition, 
NutritionOrder, PlanDefinition, Procedure, ServiceRequest</tt> and <a href="#Taskl" target="fhirweb">Task</a>.

</td>
<td> 12.17.3.3 Applying an ActivityDefinition
<br/><br/>
 The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the PlanDefinition and ActivityDefinition resources, as well as a typical application to 
 CarePlan, RequestGroup, and Request resources<br/>
<img src="./img/action-and-activity-definition.png" alt="action-and-activity-definition.png" width="100%"><br/>

To accommodate the variability in systems and use cases, this specification is not prescriptive about exactly how an ActivityDefinition 
is applied to produce target request or event resources. However, the approach depicted above provides a general framework for the process, 
and the following steps provide more detail on the potential approach (see 12.17.3.3).

<tr id="Task"><td>
<h3><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/task.html" target="fhirweb">12.1 Resource Task</a></h3>
A <ks>Task</ks> resource describes an activity that can be performed and tracks the state of completion of that activity. <br/>
It is a representation that an activity should be or has been initiated, and eventually, represents the successful or unsuccessful completion of that activity.

A <ks>Plan</ks> resource is a <i>definition resource</i> from a FHIR workflow perspective.
<br/><br/>
A plan definition is a pre-defined group of actions to be taken in particular circumstances, often including conditional elements, 
options, and other decision points. <br/>
The resource is flexible enough to be used to represent a variety of workflows, as well as clinical decision support and quality improvement assets, 
including order sets, protocols, and decision support rules.
