The Software is provided by QSI to customers primarily as a convenience at this time. The terms of this Agreement will apply to your use of the Software, including any revisions or new releases QSI may provide you at any time.

Terms
License Grant
QSI hereby grants to you, and you accept, a nonexclusive license to use the Software, provided in machine-readable, object-code form, only as authorized in this Agreement. No source code will be provided and/or made available to You.

You agree that you will not assign, sublicense, transfer, pledge, lease, rent, or share your rights under this Agreement. You agree that you may not reverse assemble, reverse compile or otherwise translate the Software.

You may not rent, lease or lend the Software.

Upon loading the Software into your computer, you may retain, for backup purposes, one copy of the Software. Any copies of the Software or any related user documentation shall include QSI's copyright and other proprietary notices. Except as authorized under this paragraph, no copies of the Software or any portions thereof may be made by you or any person under your authority or control.

License Fees
The Software is provided without charge. Other fees, if any, are payable only as separately stipulated by QSI and agreed to, in writing, by Customer.

Proprietary Rights
The Software and related user documentation are proprietary products of QSI protected under U.S. copyright law. All right, title, and interest in and to the Software, including associated intellectual property rights, are and shall remain with QSI. This Agreement does not convey to you an interest in or to the Software, but only a limited right of use revocable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Feedback/Submissions
You are asked to report any error or malfunction in the Software to QSI. Although QSI assumes no legal obligation with respect to your use of the Software, it is QSI's intent that errors and malfunctions will be addressed through reasonable corrective efforts based on priorities and available resources QSI may assign to such errors or malfunctions.

Should you decide to transmit to QSI's Web site by any means or by any media any materials or other information (including, without limitation, ideas, concepts or techniques for new or improved services and products), whether as information, feedback, data, questions, comments, suggestions or the like, you agree such submissions are unrestricted and shall be deemed non-confidential and you automatically grant QSI and its assigns a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, transmit, distribute, create derivative works of, display and perform the same.

QSI may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days prior notice at any time, or immediately in the event of any breach by you of any term hereof. Upon any termination, you agree to return to QSI the Software and all copies and portions thereof or certify permanent deletion of all copies of the Software within your control.
