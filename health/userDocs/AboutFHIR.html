<h1>Introduction to FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)</h1>


Starting from mid-2009, the v3/RIM specifications were designed to
address one of the principal limitations of the V2 specifications – the ad-hoc and
inconsistent nature of the information exchanged using it.<br/> <br/> 

CDA, which is part of the v3/RIM specifications, has been widely adopted for information exchange
between loosely coupled healthcare systems around the world.
<br/> <br/> 
However, in spite of its success in these terms, it was clear that
there were several issues that brought v3 and the HL7 organisation itself to a
crossroads.
<ul>
<li> <i>Consistency</i>: Across the healthcare system, there is little
consensus about what information should be used, how it should be represented,
and when it should be exchanged. While v3 excelled at producing consistent definitions,
the consequence of this was that it was actually harder to use it inconsistently,
and v3's rigorous consistency turned out to be a false advantage,
since across the healthcare system, there is little
consensus about what information should be used, how it should be represented,
and when it should be exchanged. (<tt>BG-330</tt>)  <br/>
</li>
<li><i>Complexity</i>: in order to implement successfully, the specification designers and the
implementers must read and understand many layers of v3/RIM documents.  (<tt>BG-330</tt>) <br/>
Further, the custom tooling stack that HL7 had to produce to string all the layers together
requires its own expertise, and the end outcome is engineering artefacts that do not
align with what else is commonly used in the industry. (<tt>BG-330</tt>) <br/>
Truly successful implementations of v3 or CDA – and there are some – require an extensive custom stack of
libraries and templates. (<tt>BG-330</tt>)  </li>
</ul>

 
While the <k>v3/RIM</k> program had met its own goals, it was unfortunately clear that
it had not met HL7's wider goals of <b>making interoperability cheaper and easier</b> (or,
alternatively, of <i>producing standards that could compete in the market</i>, since healthcare
interoperability standards is a market of its own). (<tt>BG-330</tt>)  
<br/> <br/> 
In response to the growing awareness of this issue, HL7 created a ‘Fresh Look’
task force that was asked to examine the best ways HL7 could create interoperability
solutions, with no pre-conditions on what those solutions might be. (<tt>BG-330</tt>)  
<br/> <br/> 
The FHIR team has adopted a manifesto, a declaration of the goals and priorities of
the FHIR project. (<tt>BG-344</tt>)  <br/>
<br/>  
Interoperability specifications can be grouped into one of several different
approaches: (<tt>BG-331</tt>)
<ul>
<li><ks> Messages </ks>  : define a series of fixed information that can be exchanged between applications when a specifi c event occurs.</li>
<li><ks> Services </ks>: define a set of functional operations that one system exposes for others
to use, along with the expectations of behaviour around these.</li>
<li><ks> Documents </ks>: define a set of fixed information packages that can be exchanged or stored for later use.</li> 
</ul>

FHIR is a healthcare information exchange standard that makes use of an HL7-defined set of 'resources' to support information sharing by a variety of means, 
including documents, messages, services and RESTful interfaces.  
<br/><br/>
FHIR defines resources for clinical and administrative content (e.g. Observation, Patient, etc.) as well as resources  for 'infrastructure' purposes.  <br/>
Some of these infrastructure resources are used to define the standard itself – i.e. what the characteristics of resources are, what codes can be used in them, etc.  
<br/>
This set of infrastructure resources is referred to as the 'Conformance resources'. 

<br/><br/>

<h3>From:  <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview-arch.html" target="web">FHIR 2.16 FHIR Overview - Architects</a>. </h3>
At its core, FHIR contains two primary components:
<ul>
<li><ks>Resources</ks> - a collection of information models that define the data elements, constraints and relationships for the “business objects” most relevant to healthcare. 
From a model-driven architecture perspective, FHIR resources are notionally equivalent to a physical model implemented in XML or JSON. </li>
<li><ks>APIs</ks> - a collection of well-defined interfaces for interoperating between two applications. 
Although not required, the FHIR specification targets RESTful interfaces for API implementation. 
<br/><br/>

When considering the 
<a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=3" target="web"><ks>HL7 Services Aware Interoperability Framework (SAIF)</ks></a>,
FHIR resources and RESTful APIs represent the 'Physical Models' and 'Interface Implementations' within the 
Platform Specific Specifications layer of the Information Models and the Behavioral Models Viewpoints, respectively.

<h3>From:  <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/modules.html" target="web">FHIR 1.9 Getting Started with FHIR</a>. </h3>

FHIR is a platform specification that defines a set of capabilities use across the healthcare process, in all jurisdictions, and in lots of different contexts. 
<br/><br/>
While the basics of the FHIR specification are relatively straight-forward 
(see the Overviews: 
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html" target="web">2.13 FHIR Overview general</a> </li>

<li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview-dev.html" target="web">2.14 FHIR Overview - Developers</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview-arch.html" target="web">2.16 FHIR Overview - Architects  </a></li>
</ul>
) it can still be difficult to know where to start when implementing a solution based on FHIR.
<br/><br/>
Generally, an implementer needs to resolve:
<br/><br/>
<pre>
How will information be exchanged? (see Foundation Module)
How are terminologies being used? (see Terminology Module)
How will the information be secured? (see Security and Privacy Module)
When is information exchanged? (See Workflow Module)
What information is going to be exchanged?
</pre>

In order to help implementers find their way around the specification and answer these questions, it is organized into a set of "modules". 
Each module represents a different functional area of the specification.<br/><br/>

Dependencies between the modules are mainly downwards, with some horizontal dependencies.<br/><br/>

<h3>FHIR and REST</h3>
FHIR aspires to follow RESTful principles as much as possible.... (<tt>BG-331</tt>)   <br/>
... by adopting the form of interoperability, called an <i>Application Programming Interface</i> (<k>API</k>) ... (<tt>BG-331</tt>)  <br/> .
... rather the form based on the <i>Service Orientated Architecture</i> (<k>SOA</k>). (<tt>BG-331</tt>) 
<br/><br/>
The <k>FHIR API</k> provides a <b>record centric approach</b> to data exchange. Instead of
asking the server to perform some operation, the client tells the server what the
contents of the record should be. These services are often called <ks>CRUD</ks> services (<tt>BG-334</tt>) 

<h3>FHIR Resources</h3>
As a RESTful specification, FHIR is organized around the concept of a repository which is a list of resources of a particular kind (<tt>BG-333</tt>) 
<br/><br/>
FHIR defines around 100 type of resources (<tt>BG-333</tt>), categorized as reported in
<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html" target="web">FHIR 1.2 Resource Index</a>)

<h3>From: <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html#respatterns" target="web">FHIR 12.5.1 Workflow Resource Patterns</a></h3>
 
Many FHIR resources are used to describe entities and roles (patients, medications, etc.) 
or infrastructure (structure definitions, value sets, etc.). 
<br/><br/>
However, a large proportion of the FHIR resources are devoted to the <ks>description of activities</ks> in one fashion or another and almost all of these 
fall into the realm of workflow - they describe things:<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li> that can be done (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/definition.html" target="web">FHIR 12.2 Pattern definition </a>)</li>	
<li> that are desired to be done (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html" target="web">FHIR 12.3 Pattern request  </a>) </li> 
<li>that have been done (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/event.html" target="web">FHIR 12.4 Pattern event </a>)</li> 
</ul>
These three patterns of resources have a standard set of relationships, both with themselves, as well as with each other.<br/>
<center><img src="./img/FHIRworkflow-relations.png" alt="FHIRworkflow-relations.png" width="50%"></center>
 <br/>
 Note that requests, events and definitions don't exist in a 1:1:1 relationship.
The set of common linkages should be asserted in their respective resources. 
The specific types of responses for a given request will be governed by the <ks>Request.code</ks>, any workflow definitions/protocols referenced and local convention.

<br/><br/> 
The table summarizes the list of workflow-relevant resources<br/>

 <h3 id="12.6">From <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow-communications.html" target="fhirweb">12.6 Workflow Execution and Communication Patterns</a></h3> 
Many FHIR resources can be used within workflows <k>without using</k> FHIR to manage the execution of the workflows. <br/>
When we want to manage workflow execution with FHIR, there are several mechanisms available. <br/>
Prior to reviewing this list of options (

<br/><br/>
In addition to managing workflow with FHIR, there are also cases where management of workflow execution is not necessary, 
and supporting workflow becomes simply the use of the resource patterns in an <ks>ad-hoc</ks> fashion

 <h3>FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)</h3>

 
As a <i>RESTful specification</i>, <k>FHIR</k> is organised around the concept of a <b>repository</b>,
which is a list of resources of a particular kind. (<tt>BG-331</tt>)<br/>
<br/>
Most of the significant content of the FHIR specification is in the definition of the
particular types of resource. FHIR defines around 100 types of resource, representing
widely different types of content.(<tt>BG-334</tt>)
 
Most of the functionality of a FHIR interface is provided by  three services   (pg. 334)<br/>
<ul>
<li><ks> Instance Service </ks></li>
<li><ks> Type Service </ks></li>
<li><ks> System Service </ks></li>
</ul>



<br/><br/>
In addition to these base services that apply to all the types of resources defined
by FHIR, FHIR allows for the <b>additional special services</b> that provide specific functionality
beyond simple CRUD services. FHIR defi nes a number of useful services
itself, such as asking a server whether it considers a resource is valid, linking two
patients, or retrieving all the records associated with a particular patient. (pg. 334)<br/>

Servers can define their own addition services.(pg. 334)<br/>
