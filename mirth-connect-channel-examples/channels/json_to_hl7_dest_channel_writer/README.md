## Description
This channel receives a `json` file over an `HTTP` request, 
transforms it into an `hl7` message, and sends it to another channel. 
Templates for both the `json` and `hl7` files are included.

    Source: HTTP Listener
    Source Transformer: json to hl7
    Destination: Channel Writer

## Setup
- Import the channel.
- Update the id of the destination channel.

## Usage
To send a message to mirth connect, use the following curl request:

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @json_template.json 'http://127.0.0.1:8002/api/channels/<channel_id>/messages'

Note: `<channel_id>` must be substituted by the id of the current channel. 
Also, this curl request is sent from localhost. 
If you are trying to send a message from an external machine you must replace 127.0.0.1 
with the IP of the machine hosting the containers. 
This may be different from the host's public IP address for virtual machines. 
For example in Vagrant you will need to run `netstat -rn` to find the appropriate IP.
